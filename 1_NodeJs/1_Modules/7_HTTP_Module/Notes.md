## HTTP Module

1. The HTTP module allows developers to create an HTTP server and handle client requests and server responses.

2. It provides methods and properties to work with HTTP requests and responses, enabling the creation on REST API's, web pages and other networked applications

#### NOTE:

A web server is a software or hardware that serves web content (HTML, CSS, javaScript, etc) to clients (usually browsers) over the internet or an intranet. It uses protocols like HTTP/HTTPS to handle requests and responses.
